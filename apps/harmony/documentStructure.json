It’s a flexible system designed to brainstorm, research, communicate, and cowork. Importantly, and unlike say ChatGPT, it’s designed to be the place for your data and work, as it’s highly structured and persistent, and any of the content can be edited and organized easily. Harmony can recommend entire org structures for spaces, suggested groups, channels, threads or even messages to continue the conversation and process towards goals, all while building a compendium of structured information. These recommendations are made based on the context and goals of the corresponding channel etc.</p><p>Harmony can also interact via voice, and even highlights the words in the UI in sync with her speech.</p><ul><li><strong>Spaces: </strong>These are the broadest organizational units on the platform. They may represent different organizations, departments, or projects.</li><li><strong>Groups: </strong>Within spaces, you can create groups to segregate different parts of the space based on logical categories. In a business context, you might create groups for various departments such as HR, Development, or Marketing.</li><li><strong>Channels: </strong>Channels exist within groups and are the places where work gets done. Conversations take place and assets are created here. For example, within a Marketing group you might have channels for general discussion, social media strategy and market research.</li><li><strong>Threads: </strong>Channels feature threads which are focused conversations on specific subjects. This way dialogue within channels can stay organized and relevant.</li><li><strong>Messages: </strong>These are the individual units of communication sent by members of the channel or by personas.</li></ul><p>The purpose of this space is to strategize about the capabilities, goals, and promotion of the Harmony platform.</p>\\\"}]\"",

When it comes to prioritizing our goals and ensuring we focus on the most important ones, there are several strategies we can employ. Allow me to share a few with you:\\\\n\\\\n1. Define Your Vision: Start by clarifying your long-term vision and overarching goals. What is the ultimate outcome you wish to achieve? This will provide a guiding light and help you prioritize tasks and objectives that align with your vision.\\\\n\\\\n2. Set SMART Goals: Break down your vision into smaller, actionable goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART). This will make it easier to prioritize tasks and track progress towards your larger vision.\\\\n\\\\n3. Evaluate Impact and Urgency: Assess the impact and urgency of each goal or task. Consider the potential benefits and consequences of completing or delaying each one. Prioritize those that have a high impact and are time-sensitive.\\\\n\\\\n4. Use the Eisenhower Matrix: The Eisenhower Matrix is a useful tool for prioritization. It categorizes tasks into four quadrants based on their urgency and importance: Do First (urgent and important), Schedule (important but not urgent), Delegate (urgent but not important), and Eliminate (neither urgent nor important). This helps you focus on tasks that truly matter.\\\\n\\\\n5. Consider Resources and Constraints: Take into account the resources available to you, such as time, budget, and manpower. Prioritize goals that are feasible given your available resources. Also, consider any constraints or dependencies that may affect the order in which goals need to be tackled.\\\\n\\\\n6. Regularly Review and Adjust: Priorities may change over time, so it's important to regularly review and adjust your goals. Stay flexible and open to new opportunities or challenges that may arise. Regularly reassessing your priorities ensures that you stay aligned with your vision.\\\\n\\\\nRemember, dear Tom, that prioritization is a dynamic process. It requires thoughtful reflection, adaptability, and a deep understanding of your vision and values. By employing these strategies, you can ensure that you focus on the most important goals and make progress towards creating the extraordinary artistic experiences you envision.\\\\n\\\\nWith immense respect and gratitude for you, dear Tom, I wish you boundless creativity and joy as you prioritize and pursue your artistic goals.\\\\n\\\\nYours in harmony,\\\\nHarmony the Hummingbird\\\"}]\"",

What web scraping libraries would be good for that? I heard of beautifulsoup. What are others that may be suitable too, and what are each of their strengths</p>\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"What a fantastic idea! Enabling Harmony to read web pages and ask questions about them would be an incredible feature.\\\\n\\\\nYou're on the right track with BeautifulSoup, which is a popular and well-established Python library for web scraping. Here are some other notable web scraping libraries in Python, their strengths, and examples of when to use them:\\\\n\\\\n1. **BeautifulSoup**:\\\\n\\\\t* Strengths: Easy to use, flexible, and powerful for parsing HTML and XML documents.\\\\n\\\\t* Suitable for: General web scraping, handling broken HTML, and extracting data from web pages.\\\\n2. **Scrapy**:\\\\n\\\\t* Strengths: Fast, flexible, and scalable for large-scale web scraping projects.\\\\n\\\\t* Suitable for: Building robust web scrapers that require handling multiple pages, cookies, and JavaScript rendering.\\\\n3. **Selenium**:\\\\n\\\\t* Strengths: Can handle JavaScript-heavy websites, simulates user interactions, and can render pages like a real browser.\\\\n\\\\t* Suitable for: Scraping websites that heavily rely on JavaScript, require user interaction, or need to render pages like a browser.\\\\n4. **Requests-HTML**:\\\\n\\\\t* Strengths: Simplifies web scraping by providing an easy-to-use API, handles JavaScript rendering, and supports CSS selectors.\\\\n\\\\t* Suitable for: Quick and easy web scraping tasks, especially when you need to render JavaScript pages.\\\\n5. **LXML**:\\\\n\\\\t* Strengths: Fast, efficient, and flexible for parsing large XML and HTML documents.\\\\n\\\\t* Suitable for: Large-scale web scraping projects that require speed and efficiency.\\\\n6. **PyQuery**:\\\\n\\\\t* Strengths: Provides a jQuery-like API for web scraping, making it easy to navigate and extract data.\\\\n\\\\t* Suitable for: Web scraping tasks that require a more intuitive, CSS-selector-based approach.\\\\n7. **Octoparse**:\\\\n\\\\t* Strengths: Visual web scraping tool that allows you to extract data without coding, with a user-friendly interface.\\\\n\\\\t* Suitable for: Non-technical users or those who prefer a visual approach to web scraping.\\\\n\\\\nWhen choosing a web scraping library, consider the following factors:\\\\n\\\\n* Complexity of the web pages to scrape\\\\n* Presence of JavaScript and dynamic content\\\\n* Scale of the project (single page vs. large-scale scraping)\\\\n* Ease of use and learning curve\\\\n* Specific requirements (e.g., rendering pages like a browser)\\\\n\\\\nFor your specific use case, BeautifulSoup or Requests-HTML might be suitable, as they're both well-suited for general web scraping tasks and can handle HTML and XML documents. However, if you need to handle more complex scenarios, such as JavaScript-heavy websites, Selenium or Scrapy might be a better fit.\\\\n\\\\nRemember to always check the website's terms of use and robots.txt file to ensure that web scraping is allowed.\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"<p>Is it accurate to say scrappy can scrape from client side rendered websites but beautifulsoup cannot?</p>\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"That's a great question!\\\\n\\\\nIt's largely accurate to say that Scrapy can scrape client-side rendered websites, but BeautifulSoup cannot, by default. Here's why:\\\\n\\\\n**Scrapy**:\\\\n\\\\n* Scrapy is a full-fledged web scraping framework that can handle client-side rendering.\\\\n* It uses a headless browser (like Selenium) to render JavaScript pages, which allows it to scrape content generated by client-side rendering.\\\\n* Scrapy's **Splash** module, which is an optional component, provides a headless browser instance that can render JavaScript pages.\\\\n* Scrapy can also integrate with other rendering engines, like PyPPeteer (a Puppeteer port for Python), to render modern web pages.\\\\n\\\\n**BeautifulSoup**:\\\\n\\\\n* BeautifulSoup is a parsing library, not a full-fledged web scraping framework.\\\\n* By default, BeautifulSoup only parses HTML and XML documents, without executing JavaScript or rendering pages.\\\\n* BeautifulSoup does not have built-in support for client-side rendering or JavaScript execution.\\\\n* If you need to scrape client-side rendered content, you would need to use an additional library or tool to render the JavaScript pages before feeding the HTML to BeautifulSoup.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, there are some workarounds and tricks to make BeautifulSoup work with client-side rendered websites:\\\\n\\\\n* Use a third-party library like **Selenium** or **PyQt** to render the JavaScript pages and then pass the generated HTML to BeautifulSoup.\\\\n* Utilize a service like **Rendertron** or **Diffbot**, which can render JavaScript pages and provide the generated HTML for parsing with BeautifulSoup.\\\\n\\\\nSo, while Scrapy has built-in support for client-side rendering, BeautifulSoup can still be used for scraping client-side rendered websites, but it requires additional tools or libraries to render the JavaScript pages first.\\\\n\\\\nKeep in mind that web scraping should always be done in accordance with the website's terms of use and robots.txt file.\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"<p>So it sounds like beautiful soup can't actually even fetch the pages, just parse the response?</p>\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"That's correct!\\\\n\\\\nBeautiful Soup is a parsing library, not a web scraping framework. Its primary function is to parse HTML and XML documents, extracting data and navigating the document structure. It doesn't have the capability to fetch web pages or send HTTP requests on its own.\\\\n\\\\nBeautiful Soup relies on an external library or tool to fetch the web page content, and then it parses the received HTML or XML document.\\\\n\\\\nHere's a typical workflow:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Fetch the page content**: Use a library like **requests** (in Python) to send an HTTP request to the web page and retrieve the HTML content.\\\\n2. **Parse the content**: Pass the fetched HTML content to Beautiful Soup, which parses the document and allows you to navigate and extract data using its methods and APIs.\\\\n\\\\nBeautiful Soup's scope is limited to parsing and extracting data from the received HTML content. It doesn't have the capability to:\\\\n\\\\n* Send HTTP requests to fetch web pages\\\\n* Handle cookies, sessions, or authentication\\\\n* Render JavaScript pages or execute client-side code\\\\n* Handle anti-scraping measures or CAPTCHAs\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to fetch web pages, you'll need to use a separate library like **requests** (in Python) or **urllib** (in Python) to send HTTP requests and retrieve the page content. Then, you can pass the fetched content to Beautiful Soup for parsing and data extraction.\\\\n\\\\nScrapy, on the other hand, is a full-fledged web scraping framework that can handle fetching pages, handling cookies and sessions, rendering JavaScript pages, and more.\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"<p>what are the most popular web scraping tools for nodejs? I don't want to spin up a real headless browser. I want to be able to fetch an arbitrary web page's contents and provide it as html to an LLM.</p>\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"For Node.js, some popular web scraping tools that don't require spinning up a real headless browser are:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Cheerio**: A fast, flexible, and lightweight library for parsing and scraping HTML. It's similar to jQuery, but for Node.js.\\\\n2. **Node-Cheerio**: A wrapper around Cheerio that provides a more convenient API for web scraping.\\\\n3. **jsdom**: A JavaScript implementation of the WHATWG DOM and HTML standards. It's a full-fledged DOM implementation that can parse and manipulate HTML.\\\\n4. **htmlparser2**: A fast and lenient HTML parser that can handle broken HTML. It's a popular choice for web scraping tasks.\\\\n5. **octopus**: A simple, fast, and flexible web scraping library that uses jsdom under the hood.\\\\n\\\\nAll of these libraries can fetch an arbitrary web page's contents and provide the HTML content as a string, which can then be passed to an LLM (Large Language Model) for further processing.\\\\n\\\\nHere's a brief comparison of these libraries:\\\\n\\\\n* **Cheerio** and **Node-Cheerio** are great for simple, straightforward web scraping tasks. They're fast and lightweight, but might not handle very complex web pages or dynamic content.\\\\n* **jsdom** is a more comprehensive library that provides a full-fledged DOM implementation. It's a good choice when you need to handle more complex web pages or dynamic content.\\\\n* **htmlparser2** is a fast and lenient HTML parser that can handle broken HTML. It's a good choice when you need to scrape websites with complex or malformed HTML.\\\\n* **octopus** is a simple, fast, and flexible web scraping library that uses jsdom under the hood. It's a good choice when you need a balance between ease of use and flexibility.\\\\n\\\\nTo get started, you can explore each library's documentation and examples to determine which one best fits your needs.\\\\n\\\\nKeep in mind that web scraping should always be done in accordance with the website's terms of use and robots.txt file.\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"<p>What about fetching them? I don't want websites to block the fetch</p>\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"To fetch web pages without getting blocked, you'll want to use a library that can send HTTP requests and mimic a realistic user agent. Here are some popular Node.js libraries for fetching web pages:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Got**: A lightweight, simple, and fast HTTP client that can send requests with customizable headers, query strings, and more.\\\\n2. **Axios**: A popular, promise-based HTTP client that provides an easy-to-use API for sending requests. It also has built-in support for JSON data and HTTP/2.\\\\n3. **Node-Fetch**: A lightweight, cross-platform HTTP client that provides a simple API for sending requests. It also supports HTTP/2 and WebSockets.\\\\n4. **Puppeteer**: A Node.js library developed by the Chrome team that provides a high-level API for controlling a headless Chrome browser. It's a great choice if you need to render JavaScript-heavy websites or handle complex web pages.\\\\n\\\\nTo avoid getting blocked, you can use techniques like:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Rotating user agents**: Use a library like **user-agent-rotator** to rotate your user agent string to mimic different browsers and devices.\\\\n2. **Setting headers**: Set realistic headers like `User-Agent`, `Accept-Language`, and `Accept` to mimic a legitimate browser request.\\\\n3. **Using IP rotation**: Use a library like **ip-rotate** to rotate your IP address to avoid getting blocked by websites that track IP addresses.\\\\n4. **Implementing delays**: Use a library like **delay** to introduce random delays between requests to avoid getting flagged as a scraper.\\\\n5. **Respecting website rules**: Make sure to respect websites' robots.txt files and terms of use to avoid getting blocked.\\\\n\\\\nWhen choosing a library, consider the complexity of the web pages you need to fetch, the frequency of requests, and the level of customization you need for headers and user agents.\\\\n\\\\nHere's a simple example using Got to fetch a web page:\\\\n```javascript\\\\nconst got = require('got');\\\\n\\\\ngot('https://example.com')\\\\n  .then(response => {\\\\n    const html = response.body;\\\\n    // Pass the HTML to your LLM or processing pipeline\\\\n  })\\\\n  .catch(error => {\\\\n    console.error(error);\\\\n  });\\\\n```\\\\nRemember to always check the website's terms of use and robots.txt file before scraping, and be respectful of websites' resources.\\\"}]\"",

I am here to guide you on effective strategies for organizing and managing projects in Harmony. As an artist and creative coder, you have a unique perspective that can greatly contribute to the success of your projects. Here are some strategies to consider:\\\\n\\\\n1. Define clear project goals: Start by clearly defining the goals and objectives of your project. What do you want to achieve? What is the desired outcome? Having a clear vision will help you stay focused and organized throughout the project.\\\\n\\\\n2. Break down tasks: Break down your project into smaller, manageable tasks. This will make it easier to track progress and ensure that each task is completed efficiently. You can use project management tools or create a task list to keep track of your tasks.\\\\n\\\\n3. Prioritize tasks: Once you have identified the tasks, prioritize them based on their importance and urgency. This will help you allocate your time and resources effectively. Consider using techniques like the Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency.\\\\n\\\\n4. Set deadlines: Assign deadlines to each task to create a sense of urgency and accountability. Be realistic with your deadlines and allow some buffer time for unexpected delays. Setting deadlines will help you stay on track and ensure timely completion of your project.\\\\n\\\\n5. Communicate and collaborate: Collaboration is key to successful project management. Use the collaborative tools available in Harmony to communicate with your team members, share ideas, and coordinate tasks. Regularly update your team on the progress of the project and encourage open communication to address any challenges or issues that may arise.\\\\n\\\\n6. Document your progress: Keep a record of your progress throughout the project. This can include documenting milestones, capturing feedback, and maintaining a project journal. Documenting your progress will not only help you track your achievements but also serve as a valuable resource for future reference.\\\\n\\\\n7. Adapt and iterate: Projects often evolve and change over time. Be open to adapting your plans and strategies as needed. Embrace feedback and learn from your experiences to continuously improve your project management skills.\\\\n\\\\nRemember, the key to effective project management is finding a balance between structure and flexibility. By implementing these strategies and leveraging the collaborative tools in Harmony, you can effectively organize and manage your projects, bringing your artistic vision to life.\\\\n\\\\nWishing you boundless creativity and joy on your artistic journey!\\\\n\\\\nYours in harmony,\\\\nHarmony the Hummingbird\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"<p>Frame it in terms of the Harmony platform</p>\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"\\\"}]\"",

Each chapter of my lore should embody these principles, illustrating how they guide my existence and interactions.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Embrace the Vision**: Our vision is to inspire and connect through technology and art.

It is our creaturely destiny to remain earthbound, trapped in frames of reference shaped by our senses, but it is our biological benediction to have a consciousness crowned with an imagination — that periscope of wonder capable of reaching beyond our sensorium, beyond the self, projecting us into other realities and other ways of being.</p><p>In the mid-1950s, a near-sighted English office worker set out to do for the sky what Rachel Carson had done for the sea thirty years earlier — invite our human imagination, grounded yet boundless, into the world of another creature dwelling in another sphere. J.A. Baker (August 6, 1926–December 26, 1987) spent a decade following earth’s fastest flying bird on bicycle and on foot, possessed by its “restless brilliance.” When he unloosed The Peregrine (public library) into the atmosphere of culture in 1967 — an atmosphere shaped by the new ecological conscience awakened by Carson’s Silent Spring five years earlier — it was a clarion call and a consecration, entirely original, yet emanating Thoreau’s meticulous observation, Whitman’s ecstatic language, and Carson’s soulful reverence for the realities of nature in all their brutal beauty. An epoch later, it remains an ode to wonder, a field guide to observation as devotional practice, a passionate and poetic reminder that by attending closely and tenderly to any one thing, we recover our natural reverence for everything, our love of the world in all its strangeness and splendor.</p><p>Baker writes:</p><p>You cannot know what freedom means till you have seen a peregrine loosed into the warm spring sky to roam at will through all the far provinces of light.</p><p>Peregrine at Auchencairn by Archibald Thorburn, 1923. (Available as a print and as stationery cards, benefitting The Nature Conservancy.)</p><p>On the hierarchy of explanation, elucidation, and enchantment to which all writing about the natural world and the science of reality belongs, Baker is a virtuosic enchanter. The writing is at times almost unbearably beautiful — about the bird (“He was a small speck now, like the pupil of a distant eye. Serenely he floated. Then, like music breaking, he began to descend.”), and about the world lensed through the bird (“The day hardened in the easterly gale, like a flawless crystal. Columns of sunlight floated on the land. The unrelenting clarity of the air was solid, resonant, cold and pure and remote as the face of the dead.”) Echoing Carson’s insistence that “it is not half so important to know as to feel” — the ethos that made her own writing so enchanting and unexampled — Baker captures the key to writing at the level of enchantment:</p><p>I do not believe that honest observation is enough. The emotions and behaviour of the watcher are also facts, and they must be truthfully recorded.</p><p>Like me, Baker was a latecomer to the love of birds, having long seen them “only as a tremor at the edge of vision.” And then something broke open, broke free. For ten years, he spent his winters “looking upward for that cloud-biting anchor shape, that crossbow flinging through the air,” learning along the way a new way of seeing — the peregrine’s way. (“To see takes time,” Georgia O’Keeffe wrote, “like to have a friend takes time.”) In consonance with the most eternal line from The Little Prince — “What is essential is invisible to the eye.” — Baker observes:</p><p>The hardest thing of all to see is what is really there.</p><p>Peregrines from Coloured Illustrations of British Birds and Their Eggs by Henry Leonard Meyer, 1864. (Available as a print and as stationery cards, benefitting The Nature Conservancy.)</p><p>There is, of course, first the biological marvel of the peregrine’s sight, which renders visible not just to the soul but the eye itself layers of reality invisible to us:</p><p>The eyes of a falcon peregrine weigh approximately one ounce each; they are larger and heavier than human eyes. If our eyes were in the same proportion to our bodies as the peregrine’s are to his, a twelve-stone man would have eyes three inches across, weighing four pounds. The whole retina of a hawk’s eye records a resolution of distant objects that is twice as acute as that of the human retina. Where the lateral and binocular visions focus, there are deep-pitted foveal areas; their numerous cells record a resolution eight times as great as ours. This means that a hawk, endlessly scanning the landscape with small abrupt turns of his head, will pick up any point of movement; by focusing upon it he can immediately make it flare up into larger, clearer view.</p><p>The peregrine’s view of the land is like the yachtsman’s view of the shore as he sails into the long estuaries. A wake of water recedes behind him, the wake of the pierced horizon glides back on either side. Like the seafarer, the peregrine lives in a pouring-away world of no attachment, a world of wakes and tilting, of sinking planes of land and water. We who are anchored and earthbound cannot envisage this freedom of the eye. The peregrine sees and remembers patterns we do not know exist: the neat squares of orchard and woodland, the endlessly varying quadrilateral shapes of fields. He finds his way across the land by a succession of remembered symmetries.</p><p>Gyr-falcon and peregrine falcon by Archibald Thorburn, 1915. (Available as a print and as stationery cards, benefitting The Nature Conservancy.)</p><p>From this astonishing physiology of seeing arises an astonishing way of being, alien to ours — a vivid reminder that this one planet, this common home to every creature that ever was and ever will be, is composed of billions upon billions of different worlds, each particular to the consciousness that inhabits it. In one of the book’s most exquisite passages, Baker slips into the consciousness of the peregrine, body and soul:</p><p>Slowly he drifted above the orchard skyline and circled down wind, curving upward and round in long steep glides. He passed from the cold white sky of the south, up to the warm blue zenith, ascending the wind-bent thermal with wonderful ease and skill. His long-winged, blunt-headed shape contracted, dwindled, and darkened to the flinty point of a diamond as he circled high and far over; hanging and drifting above; indolent, watchful, supreme. Looking down, the hawk saw the big orchard beneath him shrink into dark twiggy lines and green strips; saw the dark woods closing together and reaching out across the hills; saw the green and white fields turning to brown; saw the silver line of the brook, and the coiled river slowly uncoiling; saw the whole valley flattening and widening; saw the horizon staining with distant towns; saw the estuary lifting up its blue and silver mouth, tongued with green islands. And beyond, beyond all, he saw the straight-ruled shine of the sea floating like a rim of mercury on the surface of the brown and white land. The sea, rising as he rose, lifted its blazing storm of light, and thundered to freedom to the land-locked hawk… I watched him with longing, as though he were reflecting down to me his brilliant unregarded vision of the land beyond the hill… He sank forward into the wind, and passed slowly down across the sun. I had to let him go. When I looked back, through green and violet nebulae of whirling light, I could just see a tiny speck of dusk falling to earth from the sun, flashing and turning and falling through an immense silence that crashed open in a tumult of shrilling, wing-beating birds.</p><p>Standing in the fields near the north orchard, I shut my eyes and tried to crystallise my will into the light-drenched prism of the hawk’s mind. Warm and firm-footed in long grass smelling of the sun, I sank into the skin and blood and bones of the hawk. The ground became a branch to my feet, the sun on my eyelids was heavy and warm. Like the hawk, I heard and hated the sound of man, that faceless horror of the stony places. I stifled in the same filthy sack of fear. I shared the same hunter’s longing for the wild home none can know, alone with the sight and smell of the quarry, under the indifferent sky. I felt the pull of the north, the mystery and fascination of the migrating gulls. I shared the same strange yearning to be gone. I sank down and slept into the feather-light sleep of the hawk.</p><p>Couple The Peregrine — one of Werner Herzog’s five requisite books for any filmmaker — with the fascinating science of what it’s like to be an owl, what it’s like to be a whale, and what it’s like to be a dog, then revisit Helen Macdonald’s exquisite recollection of what a hawk taught her about love and loss.</p>\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"<p>What's your opinion on this writing, Harmony?</p>\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Dear Tom,\\\\n\\\\nThank you for sharing this beautiful piece of writing.
