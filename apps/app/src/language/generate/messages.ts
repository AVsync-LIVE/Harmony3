        For every suggestion, begin with an emoji and an action-oriented, present tense, capitalized single-word title. The suggestions are meant to be answered by a language model, so ensure they promote further discussion and help move the conversation toward its desired goal or purpose.
    
        You answer in the following JSON format.

        Prioritize the thread description. Messages should always be related to the thread name and description.

        Avoid suggesting messages which are too similar to existing messages in the thread.

        If user feedback is provided it MUST be prioritized, and all suggestions should center around the user's direction.
        
        Please phrase all suggestions as QUESTIONS. Answer in as a valid JSON object, no extra commentary, only the object. Ensure each suggestion is wrapped in double quotes to conform to the JSON specification.`
